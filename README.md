# AVLTree

This is a copy of David Galles' [AVL tree visualization](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/AVLtree.html AVL tree visualization)
from his [data structure visualizations](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html data structure visualizations) project.
It has been updated to conform to the conventional numbering of nodes in AVL trees with negative and positive weights instead of using the heights of the nodes to determine if a rotation is necessary.
